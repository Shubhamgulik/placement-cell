A company constantly needs to download their data to compile different reports. You need to create an
interface for the employees of this company to fill in the data into the database and then download it in CSV
format.

- Team Career Camp wants to maintain a database of all the student interviews [only for their own
use], for this they store the following details:
#### - Batch
#### - Student Details (including college, status: [placed, not_placed])
#### - Course Scores (including DSA Final Score, WebD Final Score, React Final Score)
#### - Interviews (including company name and Date)
#### - Results (this is a mapping between company, and student, contains result: [PASS, FAIL, On Hold, Didnâ€™t Attempt])
